Demo Backbone.js TODO MVC application backed by RESTful Spray/Akka/Slick stack.

Travis CI says: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scullxbones/spray-akka-todomvc.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scullxbones/spray-akka-todomvc)

  * Almost a full Typesafe Stack (http://typesafe.com/stack).  Opted for Spray (http://spray.io) instead of Play (http://playframework.com).
  * Runs on spray-can for server
  * Built originally by giter8 template for akka 2.1.0 using Scala and SBT.
  * Supports in-memory H2 in dev mode or PGSQL in cloud mode
  * Uses bulkhead actor for database I/O
  * Fully asynchronous restful services
  * Packaged for deployment to heroku using sbt start-script plugin

To run and test it using SBT invoke: 'sbt run'

Future work:
  * Fix POST where id already exists - should be 303 See Other
  * Add travis CI
  * Convert to multi-tenant
  * Integrate with app direct APIs (http://www.appdirect.com/)
